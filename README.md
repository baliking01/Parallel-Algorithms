# Gaussian Blur
Given 2 parameters: the path to the target image and the sigma value that controls the intensity of the blurring effect, the program applies Gaussian Blur to the image and produces a copy with the same name that has "Blurred" appended at the end.

Only 24-bit BMP images are valid inputs.


# Threaded quicksort algorithms
Quicksort written both in C and C++, where the former uses pthread and the latter the thread library.

For comparison reasons and additional function of quicksort can also be found in the fils that serves as a relative base for execution speed comparision.
